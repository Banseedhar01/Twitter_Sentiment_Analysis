PersonB: Oh yeah, heard of it, but not seen it yet? Any good?
PersonA: Well, yes! I just said it was, LOL. It's about a fictional Ivy League University and the students in one House of Residence.
PersonB: Why is it called Dear White People?
PersonA: That's the name of the radio show the main character, Sam, presents on college radio.
PersonB: Yeah, but why is it so good?
PersonA: Well, it's mainly stories from the perspective of black students there, which I find very interesting. The characters are strong and likeable too.
PersonB: I suppose it's rather different from the UK, then?
PersonA: It seems so, as there is a lot more racial awareness and discrimination there than here. It all kicks off when there is a Blackface party held by an elite group of white students, which gets out of hand.
PersonB: How's that?
PersonA: Well, obviously, the black students try to break it up and there's also an incident where one guy, Reggie, gets a loaded gun pointed at him by a campus policeman after he gets into an argument with a white student. It may be at another party, though, I'm not sure of that.
PersonB: Oh, that sounds pretty strong stuff. What else happens?
PersonA: Well, there is a young black guy called Lionel who is coming to terms with being gay and is finding his voice as a journalist. He unearths corruption at the uni and he and Sam also uncover some conspiracy theory stuff about secret societies.
PersonB: Well, I must say, it does sound good, I'll check it out soon!

PersonC: Probably so. Not sure, though.
PersonB: How about u, Vic?
PersonA: I still prefer Facebook. Had Twitter once, but the interaction with others is nothing compared with Facebook.
PersonC: Well, it's intended in a completely different way. 
PersonA: What do u mean?
PersonC: IMO, Twitter is not for interacting like on Facebook, but for getting news fast and from reliable, more or less, sources. U can follow anyone and anyone can follow u.
PersonA: Still, on Facebook I can share stuff with my friends, join groups and talk about things that interest me. And I don't have to limit myself to 140 characters.
PersonC: 280. Still, a downside. OTOH, if ppl were able to write as much as they wanted, Twitted would get as cluttered as Facebook.
PersonB: So no one uses 4 example Instagram?
PersonA: I do. 
PersonC: Not 4 me. I don't post that many pictures online. 
PersonB: But u can follow ppl and see what they're doing or offering. There are also companies on Instagram.

Air PersonA: After checking your flight is operated by Delta Airlines for departure from the United States. Online registration works from the Delta  site.
PersonB: Hello again , i still have trouble for my son' s online registration. I'm really angry as it cost me more than 40 euros  for 20 minutes on your short number 3654, and still i don't have any answer. He couldn't get his flight yesterday, so i asked for it to be postpone. I twice gave my credit number but still the ticket is not delivered.

Air PersonA: Please, be awared it could take 24 hours
PersonB: I can't wait so long. My son is only 16 year old and he has to sleep in the airport, with no mean to leave his luggage as he has no ticket.

PersonB: My  phone number is XXXX, please call me back as soon as possible
PersonB: Hello, i was again on line with people from the  short number. They told me that they've done everything possible but my payment can't be accepted because the flight is operated by Delta. Please consider a young stuck in US with no possibilites  for coming back just because of Delta and Air France sharing code, can't  share payment. Shame on you.

672,13731166,"PersonB: Hello. I have had a good look and have done some tests on the mould in your spare bedroom upstairs and in the dinign room.
PersonA: Hello Andy. Thank you for that, what are your thoughts? 
PersonB: I think it is caused by condensation, as most of the moist settles on and around the windows.
PersonA: Why is that?
PersonB: Those are the coldest areas and therefore where the moist in the warm air turns into water. On the windows its just water, on the walls the moist will allow mould to grow.
PersonA: So why is it all over the spare room walls, and all around the dining room? but not in other rooms?
PersonB: Probably because they have external walls which are cooler than internal walls.
PersonA: so why only that bedroom and not the other ones?
PersonB: I guess those rooms are most effected as the spare room is next to the bathroom and the dining room next to the kitchen.
PersonA: But why isnt there mould on the kitchen and bathroom itself then?
PersonB: I think that is because the kitchen doesn't have external walls and the bathroom has only one external wall and a fan in it. The difference when i measured it between internal wall and external wall is about 4 degrees.  
PersonA: Does that mean we need new double glazed windows or new wall insulation?
PersonB: Not necessarily. that would make a little difference but would still leave you with moist air in the house, so it would just settle somewhere else.  
PersonA: So what would you recommend?
PersonB: I would install a fan system, or PIV system, which would circulate air to dilute and take some moisture out of the air. It would be installed in your loft and be on continuously during day and night. 
PersonA: That sounds good. would that be sufficient? 
PersonB: If you buy a decent size it will be, but you would also need to treat your walls to get rid of the current mould. That will not go away by itself.
PersonA: OK, is this something your company can help with?
PersonB: It is indeed, we can repaint as well if you want.

PersonA: You can have coeliac disease which makes it impossible for you to digest gluten or be allergic to gluten.

PersonC: My friend was told that she may be intolerant or allergic and she did a blood test - she's absolutely fine
PersonD: I may do it as well. I feel weird recently, bloated and I gain weight even though I don't eat much
PersonA: But do you feel differently after eating gluten? Jack's right, you should do a blood test first, but you can test it yourself. Stop eating gluten for a month and see if you feel better
PersonB: I did the same thing with lactose, I wasn't feeling great after drinking coffee with milk, etc. I stopped eating it and I'm much better now
PersonC: But did it happen suddenly or were you always like this?
PersonB: It just happened, I was all right until I wasn't. I don't know how it works, but it happens
PersonD: I think it's the same with me. I was fine, but recently it's a real nightmare
PersonA: You should quit eating gluten and see, otherwise you should look for a different explanation. Maybe it has nothing to do with food?
PersonD: I had a basic blood test and everything's fine. My GP said all my problems are linked to my diet
PersonA: It may be, but I'm not so sure. Although, changing your diet and eating healthier can't do you any harm
