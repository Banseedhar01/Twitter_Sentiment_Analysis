My hubby's away this weekend, so I have no one to leave the kids with ;(\r\nPersonB: Take them to Megan's place, they can help her clean :D\r\nPersonA: You know what? I don't care. I can watch your kids, Roseanne. Just bring them over.\r\nPersonC: But are you serious or just mad at us?\r\nPersonA: No, I'm serious. I like your kids. And they're nice enough that if I ask them to do something, they actually do it :D\r\nPersonC: LOL, okay. Actually, I think that when I tell them to go and help aunt Meg with cleaning, they'll think it's fun.\r\nPersonB: And when you tell them to clean their own rooms, they say you're a monster? :D\r\nPersonC: Exactly. But Bill for example always cleans the windows at my parents house. They don't even need to ask anymore, he simply knows it's his job.\r\nPersonD: Do they pay him? :P\r\nPersonC: Well, sometimes. But still I think he likes doing it. I don't know, maybe it's because no one checks if he did it well, he's just left alone to do his thing, so he feels like a man in the house in a way?\r\nPersonA: Tell them I can pay with cookies if they help me.\r\nPersonC: The famous chocolate cookies?\r\nPersonA: Why not? I'm feeling generous today :D\r\nPersonC: Guys, I think I'm gonna change my mind about that beer. Meg, would you accept one more helper? :D\r\nPersonA: You're always welcome! But sorry boys, it's going to be a \u201cgirls only\u201d event (except for little Billy). Otherwise my house will never get cleaned today :D",

I'm vaguely considering going down to Onrus again, most likely in January. What does it look like with vacancies then?\r\nPersonA: Perfect! Just give me your dates and I'll keep it booked for you.\r\nPersonB: Would you prefer me to do it via airbnb website or just like this directly with you?\r\nPersonA: I think it'll be more advantageous for both of us to do it directly. Do you know exactly when you'll be coming?\r\nPersonB: Not so much. Can I get back to you in 2, 3 days' time?\r\nPersonA: ASAP really. As I say we've been receiving bookings daily now.\r\nPersonB: Well, no big deal. I'll be staying in Cape Town for a longer time and am quite flexible in my dates.\r\nPersonA: Will you be coming with Tino, if I may ask?\r\nPersonB: No. I am single again. Hurray! So pls make it single occupancy any week in January, Anton.\r\nPersonA: Great! 4th till 12th?\r\nPersonB: Very good. I'll call you beforehand from Cape Town. Greetings to you both!\r\nPersonA: Take care!",

Merry Christmas to you too ;) How are you??? :D\r\nPersonA: I'm good thank you just sleepy haha :) how about you?\r\nPersonA: How's things going with studying\r\nPersonB: Oh dear :P What have you been up to? ;) I'm not that sleepy, even though I did get to bed late :P\r\nPersonB: Uni's hard work (no changes there), but I really like my subjects this semester - on of my subjects is Microbiology (so all on bacteria), another is on the Biochemical Pathways to Metabolic Illnesses (basically diabetes and obesity) - so, pretty cool stuff :D\r\nPersonB: WHat about you? Are you having fun?\r\nPersonA: Sounds interesting I've gotta say. Particularly the bacteria stuff! I've been on a walk today so quite tired from that. And I'm enjoying uni yeah! Very very busy. Starting dissertation stuff soon and had a lot of work for essays\r\nPersonB: Did you take any photos whilst on your walk? :D So... what does your dissertation stuff look like? Are you in any Uni groups?\r\nPersonA: Got some yeah :) posted one to Facebook. Mine is looking like geography and politics related. Not sure about uni groups? What's your dissertation on if you have to do one?\r\nPersonB: We don't really have dissertations... at the end of my third year I'll be writing my degree, so that will be like a slightly longer lab report :) Geography and politics - hmmm... that's  a pretty wide topic, I mean, you could talk about Global warming etc. right?\r\nPersonA: Aah ok. So the long report is a big part of your degree and counts a lot towards it?\r\nPersonA: And it's very wide the topic. Can talk about that yes, can also do social and cultural stuff too in there\r\nPersonB: Yeah, basically my grades and my report make up my degree :) Social and cultural stuff... like what?\r\nPersonA: Aaah cool :D I have exams too which make mine up haha. Lucky you\r\nPersonA: And stuff like social separation and classes and how everything plays into each other and culture is like heritage and what matters to different people\r\nPersonB: I meant grades from exams, so I don't know if I'm really that lucky :P That's actually really interesting! So how do you prepare for this? Do you get to interview people?\r\nPersonA: Oh right haha. And I have to do loads of reading and prepare some fieldwork. And I likely will have to inerview people yeah. What kind of things do you do in the lab?\r\nPersonB: Depends on your field of study - I'm doing Embriology, so I basically conduct experiments on mouse oocytes that should hopefully give some decent results. But other people can grow bacteria on petri dishes if they're doing Microbiology, or study particular fragments of DNA if they're doing Genetics\r\nPersonB: It really depends on what you're studying - Biology has a pretty large spectrum, afterall :)",

I can't.\r\nPersonA: Nor can I.\r\nPersonB: We even stopped talking about his drinking problem long ago.
