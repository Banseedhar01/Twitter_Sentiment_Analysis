PersonB: Whatta hell are you two talking about??
PersonB: McGregor and boxing?? He's an mma warrior, those R 2 different worlds! Wtf
PersonB: And Mayweather?? He's fuckin 40, he's to fuckin old to fight!

PersonA: He was, actually I was surprised cause he was fighting pretty well for 5 maybe 6 rounds
PersonA: Floyd had to keep his guard up and seemed to have little chances cuz the Irishman was attacking again an again
PersonA: But you know, Floyd is an old bird and all this time he was waiting for Conor to get tired and you know the rest :)
PersonB: Experience bitch, he beat 'The Notorious' thanks to his fuckin experience!
PersonA: No doubt about it, bro

PersonB: True

PersonD: I don't get why it matters so much whether I clean my flat once a week or once a month. No one died from a bit of dust.
PersonA: Remind me to never stay at your place :P
PersonC: I'm somewhere in between. My house is always a mess, but I hate it when it's dirty.
PersonB: What's the difference?
PersonC: I can't stand when there's dust, crumbs on the floor etc., so I clean regularly. But I love it when all my stuff just lies around. When I put everything back on shelves or into cabinets, I keep on getting mad that I have to look for it, get up and take it out, and generally lose so much time.

PersonC: But are you serious or just mad at us?
PersonA: No, I'm serious. I like your kids. And they're nice enough that if I ask them to do something, they actually do it :D
PersonC: LOL, okay. Actually, I think that when I tell them to go and help aunt Meg with cleaning, they'll think it's fun.
PersonB: And when you tell them to clean their own rooms, they say you're a monster? :D
PersonC: Exactly. But Bill for example always cleans the windows at my parents house. They don't even need to ask anymore, he simply knows it's his job.
PersonD: Do they pay him? :P
PersonC: Well, sometimes. But still I think he likes doing it. I don't know, maybe it's because no one checks if he did it well, he's just left alone to do his thing, so he feels like a man in the house in a way?
PersonA: Tell them I can pay with cookies if they help me.
PersonC: The famous chocolate cookies?

PersonA: Oh right haha. And I have to do loads of reading and prepare some fieldwork. And I likely will have to inerview people yeah. What kind of things do you do in the lab?
PersonB: Depends on your field of study - I'm doing Embriology, so I basically conduct experiments on mouse oocytes that should hopefully give some decent results. But other people can grow bacteria on petri dishes if they're doing Microbiology, or study particular fragments of DNA if they're doing Genetics
